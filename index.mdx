description: "Your guide to running every recruiting search, update, and workflow inside Lope."

Lope is the recruiter-first workspace that keeps talent pipelines, client touchpoints, and smart automations in sync. Use this guide to understand the platform, learn the daily rhythm, and see how Lope does the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

## Where Lope fits with your ATS

Lope doesn’t replace your ATS. It plugs into it. You import candidates via CSV or one-way integrations from tools like Bullhorn, Greenhouse, or Lever, and Lope enriches, searches, and structures that data so you can actually reuse your existing database instead of going straight back to LinkedIn.

## What’s new with the Lope brand

<Info>
  Lope is simply the new name and look for the product you knew as Kaktus. Your workspaces, data, automations, and permissions remain exactly the same—just with a refreshed gradient and updated typography from the Lope brand book.
