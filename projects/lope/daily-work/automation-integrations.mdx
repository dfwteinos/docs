Lope quietly coordinates interviews, enrichment, candidates, and access control so your team always works with fresh information. Here is a plain-language tour of the most important systems and what they do for you.

## Lope + ATS: how they work together

Lope plugs into your ATS to keep data in sync automatically - no extra manual updates required.

- **ATS Export.** Export candidates from your ATS (e.g., Bullhorn, Greenhouse, Lever) as CSV and import them into Lope.
- **One-Way Integration.** For some ATSs, Lope can connect one-way to receive candidate data automatically.
- **Lope runs in the background.** Keep running your jobs and compliance in your ATS; use Lope to enrich, search, run interviews, and present structured shortlists to clients.
- **Updates.** When a candidate is hired, you can update your ATS as usual; Lope will automatically update it as well.

## Candidate sheet: your single source of truth

For every candidate, Lope keeps one central profile:

- **Core info.** Name, contact details, location, current role, links (LinkedIn, GitHub).
- **CV & Enrichment.** Parsed CV fields plus data pulled from LinkedIn/GitHub.
- **Interviews.** Candidate transcripts and AI summaries from the Notetaker.
- **Fit Signals.** Instant job fit signals in every candidate sheet.
- **Smart report.** Short AI-generated summary of fit against a specific role, which you can tweak before sharing.

## Data import & enrichment flows

- **CSV imports.** Upload candidate lists exported from your ATS or spreadsheets.
- **Bulk CV upload.** Drop a .zip of CVs; Lope creates candidate rows automatically.
- **Bulk enrichment.** Select a group of candidates and run LinkedIn/GitHub enrichment in bulk; track how many profiles were successfully enriched.

## Sourcing

- **Chrome extension.** Add LinkedIn profiles without leaving the page. The extension respects your Lope login so you never re-authenticate mid-flow.

<Note>
  No need to connect your **LinkedIn** account - risk free!

## Trust & security

- **Role-based access.** Every invite is scoped by workspace, teamspaces, and roles so each teammate only gets access to what they’re meant to own.
- **Data residency.** Lope runs on Supabase with strict row-level security, meaning each workspace owns its data.
- **Audit.** Key actions (like stage changes and generated reports) are logged internally so we can help you troubleshoot and improve over time.

Together, these systems free you from constant admin work. Pair this knowledge with the Daily Work guide to make the most of every automation Lope offers.
