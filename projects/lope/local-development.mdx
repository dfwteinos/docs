Lope is designed so recruiters can jump in, see what matters, and keep moving. Use this page as your checklist for onboarding yourself, preparing a search, and staying ahead of every conversation.

## First-time setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accept your invite">
    Open the Lope invitation email, choose a password, and land on the Home view that summarizes all open work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect calendars">
    Use the **Calendar & Integrations** panel to link Google or Microsoft. Lope now keeps interviews, reschedules, and Meet links fresh automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import your roles">
    Create a new project or reuse an existing one, set the stages you care about, and pull in any candidates via CSV, ATS export, or the Chrome extension.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite collaborators">
    Share access with hiring managers or clients. Each invite is scoped, so partners only see the roles you choose.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Spend five minutes labeling your stages and automations. That small upfront effort gives you accurate reports and on-time reminders for the rest of the search.
</Tip>

## Your morning rhythm

1. **Scan Home.** Lope highlights overdue follow-ups, fresh applicants, and stalled candidates.
2. **Check Meetings.** Confirm today’s interviews and review any conflicts flagged by the calendar watch.
3. **Triage inbox items.** Notes, @mentions, and candidate questions surface in the Messages tab so nothing waits in your email.

## Sourcing from LinkedIn in seconds

- Open a profile and click the Lope extension.
- Pick the project (and role, if you have several) and add a quick note.
- Lope grabs the profile link, headline, location, and contact info, then enriches the record and alerts your teammates automatically.

<Note>
You can also drop a list of LinkedIn URLs or resumes into Lope. The same enrichment will run—no need to retype anything.
</Note>

## Keeping clients and hiring managers in sync

- **Share views.** Send a live link that mirrors what you see in the pipeline, with optional filters to hide sensitive data.
- **Highlight progress.** Use the built-in update template to summarize wins, blockers, and asks. Lope pulls metrics (submitted, interviewing, offer) for you.
- **Capture feedback.** When stakeholders leave notes or status changes, you’ll see them instantly and can nudge candidates without waiting for an email.

## End-of-day habits

- Move any candidates that changed status—even if only from “Screened” to “Prepping interview.” This keeps automations accurate.
- Snooze or dismiss reminders so tomorrow’s Home view only shows fresh items.
- Jot quick takeaways in the project timeline. Future-you (and your teammates) will thank you when prepping recap reports.

Lope keeps the busywork out of your way so you can focus on building relationships. Check the Automations page next to see how CV parsing, enrichment, and calendar intelligence help you stay ahead without extra clicks.
