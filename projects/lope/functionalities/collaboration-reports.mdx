## Collaboration

### Overview

Lope is built for teams. You can invite recruiters, hiring managers, and clients to collaborate in **Workspaces** and **Teamspaces**.

**Prerequisites:**
- You must be a Workspace Admin to invite members or change roles.

### UI Reference

| Element | Location | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Invite Member** | Teamspace Settings / Workspace Settings | Opens a modal to send email invitations. |
| **Role Selector** | Invite modal | Choose between *Admin*, *Member*, or *Guest*. |
| **Teamspaces** | Sidebar | Folders that organize projects and control access permissions. |

### How-to / Processes

### FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between a Workspace and a Teamspace?">
    A **Workspace** is your company's main account (billing, all data). A **Teamspace** is a sub-folder (e.g., "Engineering Hiring", "Marketing Roles") to organize projects and limit access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I invite a client with read-only access?">
    Yes. Invite them as a **Guest** to a specific Teamspace or Project. They will see candidates but cannot delete data or change settings.

## Reports

| **Create Report** | Candidate Sheet / Project Actions | Starts the report builder flow. |
| **Share Link** | Report View | Generates a public, read-only link to the report. |
| **Export PDF** | Report View | Downloads the report as a PDF file. |

### How-to / Processes

5. Click **Generate Link**.
6. Copy the link and send it to your client.
