## AI Notetaker

Lope’s Notetaker automatically joins your calls, records the audio, and writes a structured summary.

### UI Reference

| Element         | Location        | Action                                                             |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meeting Bot** | Home Page       | Shows status of the bot (Prep Pending, Prep Completed, Bot Ready). |
| **Transcript**  | Candidate Sheet | Full text of the conversation with speaker labels.                 |
| **Summary**     | Candidate Sheet | AI-generated interview summary                                     |

### How to use the Notetaker

1. Schedule a Google Meet or Teams call from your calendar.
2. Ensure the candidate's email in the invite matches their Lope record.
3. Lope detects the event and sends the bot to join at the start time.
4. After the call ends, check the **Candidate Sheet**. The transcript and summary will appear automatically within minutes.

## AI Scout (Semantic Search)

Instead of keyword matching ("Java" AND "Berlin"), AI Scout understands intent ("Senior engineers who have led teams").

### How to run an AI Search

1. Go to the **Candidates** page.
2. Click the **AI Scout** toggle in the top-left above the candidate table.
3. Type your query (e.g., "Marketing managers with SaaS experience in London").
4. Lope ranks candidates by relevance score (0–10) and highlights _why_ they match in their candidate sheet.

## Smart Reports

Generate a client-facing PDF or text that summarizes why a candidate is a good fit.

### How to generate a report

1. Open a **Candidate Sheet**.
2. Click the **Generate** **Report** tab in the top-right corner.
3. Alternatively, you can select one or more candidates in the table and click **Generate Report** in the toolbar above.
4. The report will be generated based on the job you've assigned to each candidate.
5. Lope writes a narrative summary. You can edit it before downloading as PDF or copying the text.
