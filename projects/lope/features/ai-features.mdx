## AI Notetaker

Lope’s Notetaker joins your calls, records the audio, and writes a structured summary.

### UI Reference

| Element         | Location                     | Action                                                         |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meeting Bot** | Candidate Sheet → Interviews | Shows status of the bot (Joined, Processing, Completed).       |
| **Transcript**  | Candidate Sheet → Interviews | Full text of the conversation with speaker labels.             |
| **Summary**     | Candidate Sheet → Interviews | AI-generated scorecard (Strengths, Weaknesses, Key Takeaways). |

### How to use the Notetaker

1. Schedule a Google Meet or Teams call as usual.
2. Ensure the candidate's email in the invite matches their Lope record.
3. Lope detects the event and sends the bot to join at the start time.
4. After the call ends, check the **Candidate Sheet**. The transcript and summary will appear automatically within minutes.

## AI Scout (Semantic Search)

Instead of keyword matching ("Java" AND "Berlin"), AI Scout understands intent ("Senior engineers who have led teams").

### How to run an AI Search

1. Go to the **Candidates** page.
2. Click the **AI Scout** toggle in the top-left.
3. Type your query (e.g., "Marketing managers with SaaS experience in London").
4. Lope ranks candidates by relevance score (0–100%) and highlights _why_ they match.

## Smart Reports

Generate a client-facing PDF or link that summarizes why a candidate is a good fit.

### How to generate a report

1. Open a **Candidate Sheet**.
2. Click the **Reports** tab.
3. Select **Generate Report**.
4. Choose the job context (e.g., "Fit for Senior Designer role").
5. Lope writes a narrative summary. You can edit it before downloading as PDF or sharing a link.

## FAQ

**Q: Does the Notetaker record video?** A: No, only audio and transcript.

**Q: Can I edit the AI summary?** A: Yes. Click the **Edit** icon on any report or summary to refine the text before sharing.

**Q: Why didn't the bot join my call?** A: Check that the meeting link was valid and that the bot was admitted from the lobby. Also, ensure the calendar event was synced to Lope.
