Lope quietly coordinates calendars, enrichment, inboxes, and access control so your team always works with fresh information. Here is a plain-language tour of the most important systems and what they do for you.

## Calendar intelligence

- **Automatic watches.** When you log a meeting link for a candidate, Lope creates a watch with Google or Microsoft so the moment the event shifts, the candidate record updates.
- **Conflict alerts.** If a link disappears, overlaps, or expires, Lope posts a warning on the meeting card and pings you in Messages.
- **Shared visibility.** Hiring managers only see the meetings tied to their projects, but they always have the latest join link and time zone conversion.

<Warning>
If a candidate or manager edits an event title instead of the time, Lope may not detect the change. Ask partners to modify the time directly to stay synced.
</Warning>

## Candidate intelligence

- **CV parsing.** Drag in a PDF and Lope extracts experience, skills, education, and contact details within seconds.
- **Enrichment.** Lope cross-checks new entries against existing records so you avoid duplicates and keep a clean talent pool.
- **Smart filters.** Because every profile is structured, you can build saved searches (e.g., “back-end + fintech + Berlin”) that stay updated as you add more talent.

## Sourcing & communication add-ons

- **Chrome extension.** Add LinkedIn profiles, notes, and tags without leaving the page. The extension respects your Lope login so you never re-authenticate mid-flow.
- **Email nudges.** Lope drafts reminders and thank-you notes with the right meeting details; you just personalize and send.
- **Client invites.** Give stakeholders real-time dashboards with read-only or comment-level access so updates stop clogging your inbox.

<Note>
Need a branded recap? Use the **Share Update** button inside any project—Lope pulls metrics and top highlights into a clean email or PDF.

## Trust & security

- **Role-based access.** Every invite is scoped by workspace, project, and even pipeline stage, so contractors and clients only see what you approve.
- **Audit trail.** Key actions—stage changes, notes, meeting edits—are logged with timestamps and the teammate responsible.
- **Data residency.** Lope runs on Supabase with strict row-level security, meaning each workspace owns its data, even when multiple agencies collaborate.

Together, these systems free you from constant babysitting. Pair this knowledge with the Daily Work guide to make the most of every automation Lope offers.
