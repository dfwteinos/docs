Lope quietly coordinates calendars, enrichment, inboxes, and access control so your team always works with fresh information. Here is a plain-language tour of the most important systems and what they do for you.

## AI Notetaker

Lope joins your interviews to capture every detail so you can focus on the candidate.

- **Universal support.** Works on Google Meet and Microsoft Teams.
- **Smart summaries.** Turns transcripts into structured scorecards with key takeaways.
- **Instant recall.** Saves the summary directly to the candidate's timeline for easy review.

## Calendar intelligence

- **Automatic watches.** When you log a meeting link, Lope creates a watch with Google or Microsoft so the record updates instantly if the event shifts.
- **Conflict alerts.** Lope flags missing or expired links directly on the meeting card.
- **Shared visibility.** Hiring managers see only the meetings relevant to their projects, with up-to-date links and time zones.

<Warning>
If a candidate or manager edits an event title instead of the time, Lope may not detect the change. Ask partners to modify the time directly to stay synced.
</Warning>

## Candidate intelligence

- **CV parsing.** Drag in a PDF and Lope extracts experience, skills, education, and contact details within seconds.
- **Enrichment.** Lope cross-checks new entries against existing records so you avoid duplicates and keep a clean talent pool.
- **Smart filters.** Structured profiles allow you to save searches (e.g., “back-end + fintech + Berlin”) that stay updated as you add more talent.

## Sourcing & communication

- **Chrome extension.** Add LinkedIn profiles, notes, and tags without leaving the page. The extension respects your Lope login so you never re-authenticate mid-flow.
- **Email nudges.** Lope drafts reminders and thank-you notes with the right meeting details; you just personalize and send.
- **Client invites.** Share real-time dashboards with read-only or comment-level access so updates stop clogging your inbox.

<Note>
Need a branded recap? Use the **Share Update** button inside any project—Lope pulls metrics and top highlights into a clean email or PDF.

## Trust & security

- **Role-based access.** Every invite is scoped by workspace, project, and even pipeline stage, so contractors and clients only see what you approve.
- **Audit trail.** Key actions—stage changes, notes, meeting edits—are logged with timestamps and the teammate responsible.
- **Data residency.** Lope runs on Supabase with strict row-level security, meaning each workspace owns its data, even when multiple agencies collaborate.

Together, these systems free you from constant babysitting. Pair this knowledge with the Daily Work guide to make the most of every automation Lope offers.
