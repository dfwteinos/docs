## Why recruiters choose Lope

- **Live interviews.** Lope connects to your calendar so the AI Notetaker can join interviews and keep interview events up to date when times change. You still schedule meetings in your existing tools; Lope listens for changes and ties transcripts and summaries back to the right candidate.
- **AI Scout.** Scans your whole candidate database with AI and instantly surfaces a ranked shortlist of the best matches for any role based on your job description, a custom prompt or a similarity with a star candidate.
- **Automatic context.** CV parsing, data enrichment, interview transcripts and candidate fit signals happen in the background, giving you back time to talk to humans.
- **Powerful Extension.** The Chrome extension lets you add enriched LinkedIn profiles to the right job in seconds; no copy/paste or extra browser tabs. It also generates a quick outreach message tailored to each candidate, based on the job's description.
