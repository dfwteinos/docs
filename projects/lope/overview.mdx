Lope is the new name for the platform previously known as Kaktus. Nothing about your day-to-day power has been removed—everything simply looks cleaner, carries the Lope brand, and centers on the metrics recruiters care about most.

## Why recruiters choose Lope

- **One cockpit for every role.** Jobs, projects, candidates, interviews, and client feedback live in one view so you no longer jump between spreadsheets and inboxes.
- **Live schedules.** Lope listens to Google and Microsoft calendars and updates meeting slots the moment a candidate reschedules.
- **Automatic context.** CV parsing, contact enrichment, and activity tracking happen in the background, giving you back time to talk to humans.
- **Sourcing superpowers.** The Chrome extension lets you add a LinkedIn profile to the right project in seconds—no copy/paste or extra browser tabs.

<Tip>
If you used “Kaktus” before, everything you know is still here. Your workspace, data, and settings simply wear Lope’s colors.
